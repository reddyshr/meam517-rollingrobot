This directory contains a package which integrates SNOPT with the
automatic differentiation system ADIFOR. Using this package, one can
formulate an optimization problem without providing code to compute
the derivatives of the functions in the model. The derivatives
provided by ADIFOR are typically much more accurate than ones that may
be obtained by a numerical differentiation scheme, and may often be
obtained more quickly.

The file named INSTALL contains installation instructions for this
package. However, if this package came as part of an SNOPT
distribution, please read the installation instructions for the SNOPT
distribution first.

For the files in this distribution to do anything useful, you will
need a copy of SNOPT and a copy of ADIFOR. You will find information
on how to obtain SNOPT on the web at:

http://www.cam.ucsd.edu/~peg/software.html

Information about ADIFOR may be found on the web at:
