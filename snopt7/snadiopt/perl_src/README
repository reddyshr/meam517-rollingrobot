 This directory and its subdirectories contain a perl
code distribution. The code parses a FORTRAN program
and generates template files that may be used as an
interface between SNOPT and the automatic
differentiation code ADIFOR.

 This perl distribution will normally be part of a
larger package containing snopt and code that
transforms the output from Adifor into a format that
snopt understands.  I can think of no reason to install
this distribution separately. The top level README
should lead to instructions on how to install the
entire package.
