Items used to implement Elastic Variables
       in SNOPT 5.3-7.2 and MINOS 5.6

eType(j) says which bounds on x(j) are elastic  (j = 1:nb)
   0   none
   1   bl(j)
   2   bu(j)
   3   both

eState(j) says which elastic bounds x(j) is currently allowed to violate
   0   none
   1   bl(j)
   2   bu(j)

Elastic Mode  0,1,2               sets eMode
   0   Don't enter Elastic mode
   1   Enter if infeasible
   2   Start there and remain there

Elastic Objective  0,1,2          sets lvlObjE and defines W1, W2
   0   W1 = 1.0   W2 = 0.0        for minimizing the
   1   W1 = 1.0   W2 = wtInf      Elastic Phase 2 composite obj
   2   W1 = 0.0   W2 = 1.0           W1*true obj + W2*sInfE

Elastic Weight  r                 sets wtInf

The optimization algorithm can pass through the following phases:

Phase 1          Find a feasible point for all variables     feasible = false
Elastic Phase 1  Make non-elastic variable feasible          feasible = false
                 while allowing infeasible elastics

Phase 2          Minimize the true objective                 feasible = true
                 while staying feasible
Elastic Phase 2  Minimize the elastic objective              feasible = true
                 while keeping the non-elastics feasible

Working variables:
Elastic  = true if elastic variables are allowed to exceed their bounds
Normal   = not Elastic
feasible = true if non-elastic variables are feasible
gotE     = true if eState(*) has been set
nInfE    = no. of elastic variables currently outside their bounds
sInfE    = sum of infeasibilities for elastic variables

nInf     = nInf(non-elastic) = no. of infeasible nonelastics
sInf     = sInf(non-elastic) = sum of nonelastic infeasibilities

On exit only:
nInf     = nInf(non-elastic) + nInfE = total no. of infeasibilities
sInf     = sInf(non-elastic) + sInfE
