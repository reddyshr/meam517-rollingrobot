snctrl/README

This directory contains the optimal control interface SNCTRL.


The user needs to configure and compile the control package since it isn't a
part of the installation of SNOPT.


Configure and install SNCTRL:
  >> ./configure  --with-snopt=/path/to/SNOPT/library
  >> make
  >> make install


8 examples (coded for each of the 3 interfaces) are included in the package.
To build the included examples:
  >> make examples


Assuming no modifcations to the location of files and libraries, an example can
be run with the following commands
  % cd $SNCTRL/examples
  % ./rocketA
