 SNOPT7/win64 - README                                               14 Jan 2017
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the README file for the Visual Studio solution files for compiling
Windows-friendly libraries and executables of SNOPT.


-------------
PREREQUISITES
-------------
  Microsoft Visual Studio
  Intel Fortran compiler
  Matlab (optional, for MEX-executable)


---------------------------
COMPILING A FORTRAN LIBRARY
---------------------------
  A Visual Studio solution file (snopt.sln) is included in the win64/ directory.
  This file can be used to compile a Fortran library.

  Additionally, see the note on 32/64-bit INTEGERS below.

  0.  Open the project file snopt.sln

  1.  Set the configuration and platform in Visual Studio (e.g., Release,
      Win32|x64)

  2.  Right-click on the project and select Build

  3.  Once finished, the Fortran library named snopt.lib will be placed in the
      lib/ directory

  4.  A test example springa is included.  To compile, right-click on the springa
      project and select Build

  5.  The executable springa will appear in the examples/ directory


---------------------
COMPILING A C LIBRARY
---------------------
  0.  Open the project file snopt.sln

  1.  Set the configuration and platform in Visual Studio (e.g., Release,
      Win32|x64)

  2.  Right-click on the project 'snopt_c' and select Build

  3.  Once finished, the Fortran library named snopt_c.lib will be placed in the
      lib/ directory

  4.  A test example snopt-c-example is included.  To compile, right-click on the
      snopt-c-example  project and select Build

  5.  The executable snopt-c-example will appear in the interfaces/cexamples/ directory


-------------------------------------------
COMPILING A MATLAB (Fortran) MEX-EXECUTABLE
-------------------------------------------
  A Visual Studio solution file is included in the win64 directory.
  This file can be used to compile a MEX-executable (snoptmex.mexw*) to run
  SNOPT in MATLAB.  Some minor modifications may be necessary.

  0.  Open the solution file snopt.sln

  1.  Set the configuration and platform in Visual Studio (e.g., Release,
      Win32|x64)

  2.  Right-click on the snoptmex project and select Properties

  3.  Under the Fortran -> General section of Configuration Properties, modify
      the path to MATLAB in the "Additional Include Directories" entry

      Normally, the entry looks like
          C:\Program Files\Matlab\R20***\extern\include

  4.  Under the Linker -> General section, modify the path to MATLAB in the
      "Additional Library Directories" entry

      Normally, the entry looks like
          C:\Program Files\Matlab\R20***\extern\lib\win64\microsoft\

  5.  Close the Properties

  6.  Right-click on the snoptmex project and select Build

  7.  Once finished, the Matlab MEX-executable named snoptmex.mexw64 (or
      .mexw32) will appear in SNOPT's matlab/ directory

  8.  To test the executable, open Matlab, change to the matlab/examples
      directory and run the included script 'runAllExamples'


------------------
32/64-bit INTEGERS
------------------

  The stand-alone project file for the Fortran SNOPT library will compile with
  default integer type, which is compiler-dependent (usually integer*4).  To
  compile with integer*8, add '-i8' to the Additional Options entry under
  Fortran -> Command Line in the Configuration Properties of the solution file.

  To compile a MEX-executable for 32-bit MATLAB, switch to the 'Release' and
  'Win32' configuration in Visual Studio.  Make sure the paths to Matlab are
  appropriately modified for 32-bit.
